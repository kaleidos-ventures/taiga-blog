Reflecting on the 20th anniversary of the Agile Manifesto might easily lead to nostalgic or vindictive thoughts... This short post will stay away from that and instead **distill the two principles and the corollary** which we have taken from almost 15 years of Agile experience.

## Principle #1: Teams exist as an expression of collective solidarity and alignment

Very often we've witnessed a collection of individuals, each of them talented in their own way, that would **prioritise their own output** as a satisfactory metric, while also **neglecting the importance of focus and vision**. Little, if any, progress is made there, and when there is, most of the time, it requires **some flavour of middle-management coercion**.

A team such as we state in this principle can cope with ups and down and understand the reasons behind every decision that takes place. Less cognitive dissonance, more empathy and a more **sustainable process** altogether can flourish here.

## Principle #2: Waste is tolerable, what it isn't tolerable is not tracking it

Agile has been often considered as **an exceptionally good waste reducer**. Waste comes in all shapes and colours. Finished work that wasn't needed, meetings without the relevant stakeholders, no proper prioritisation, early optimisation, technical debt (in software development), low bus factor... **The more waste, the less predictability**.

Having said that, zero-waste policy can sometimes be problematic for one very simple reason; it's not that bad to have **some entropy flowing naturally through the process**. Besides, there are always *unknown unknowns*. As long as the team is aware of the sources of such waste and has some way of accepting it under certain circumstances, the pressure can be lifted up a bit and **allow some extra degrees of freedom**, which might ironically lead to **less overall waste**.

## Corollary: Last Responsible Moment is your rule-of-thumb decision making trick

The Last Responsible Moment for a decision is the moment at which **you cannot gain any significant information and all options are still open**. If you cross the LRM threshold, you end up with fewer options. If you don't wait for it, you might end up with a poorly informed decision.

Agile requires solid LRM. It should come as second nature to all team members and the team as a whole.

This year marks the 20th Anniversary of the Agile Manifesto. It has aged rather well. Not surprisingly, it was given birth after **the crisis of faith that was the 2000's Millennial bug and dotcom bubble burst**. Today, its simplicity and applicability **still shine** in a very different world.

### A side note

Did you know we just released **Taiga6**? A *truly* Agile Manifesto focused project management tool that's **open source** and meant for **cross-domain teams**. See [what's new!](/taiga6-release.html) or [learn all about it](https://resources.taiga.io). A coincidence? Perhaps...
