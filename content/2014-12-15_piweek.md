Have you ever dozed off on a plane and then woken up in a cold sweat, having dreamt that the pilots had bailed and no one was at the controls?

Well, for the development team at Taiga.io it's that kind of a moment. Only it's not a dream. Our favorite time of year is upon us when we basically blow you off for a WHOLE WEEK and think only ourselves! Starting Monday, Taiga users you are on your own! - We've off to ΠWEEK [1]

We call it the **[ΠWEEK](http://piweek.com/ "ΠWEEK")** (PiWeek: Personal Innovation week) and its weeklong hackathon; we code for ourselves, on the projects voted by our team, to have fun, learn, challenge ourselves and to grow as developers and designers.

This year its 15+ projects and 40+ people. Extraordinary amounts of caffeine, a lot of sleep deprivation, some Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and loads of satisfaction. Follow our [#piweek](https://twitter.com/hashtag/piweek?f=realtime "ΠWEEK on Twitter") timeline at Twitter

<small>[1] You're not really on your own. If anything goes wrong we're all over it! But please be patient with other non-urgent support issues. We'll be slower than usual.</small>
