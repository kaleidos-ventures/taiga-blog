Summary: ![Taiga Day](/images/2014-12-10_changelog140/01.jpg) It has become a 
tradition for us, to attend [FOSDEM](http://fosdem.org) (Free & Open Source 
Developers' European Meeting) every year since Taiga's parent organisation, 
Kaleidos, was born in 2011. Why? Because it is re-energising and addictive.

When we released Taiga to the public many people thought that the source code 
had been kept hidden until that moment and so we inevitably got questions as 
for "why open source it now?". And while it's true that developing in the open 
and using a free & open source license are not necessarily linked, Taiga's 
latest incarnation of its public repositories is almost [2 years 
old](https://github.com/taigaio/taiga-back/commit/
59648457109c8e6c2016546bad9b2f19b729e0d7#diff-632b651e5579af0e928ed63482e9bc77) 
now and the reason we made that choice is for things like FOSDEM.

FOSDEM is a melting pot for code, community and honesty. Its non commercial 
approach, free access and university location makes everyone feel like they are 
inside a bubble, a bubble in which you share what you've got with your peers 
while having a beer (literally). The quality of the talks and speakers are 
basically random and the 5.000+ geeks that come every year will interact with 
FOSDEM in many different ways. Some will finally meet their online 
co-developers, others will try and squeaze themselves into the packed full 
"rock-star"-driven talks, while many of them will just open their laptops and 
enjoy a 3-day hackathon knowing that virtually any major Free & Open Source 
project is present at FOSDEM one way or another.

Between Taiga and Kaleidos I think something like 15 people will be there. We 
will arrive on Friday and leave by Sunday or Monday. Jesús Espino and Alejandro 
Gómez from the Kaleidos/Taiga bundle will give a 
[couple](https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/understanding_cpython_34_objects
/) of [talks](https://fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/gradual_typing_in_python/) 
but most importantly, we will try and make ourselves visible (offline and 
online) so we can meet any of you interested in knowing the **technical aspects 
of Taiga**, **make suggestions** or even **ask for a demo**.

We would love to interact with anyone that feels that Taiga is something more 
than yet another project management tool. We come to FOSDEM to enjoy it as 
individuals but if you see anyone with a Taiga t-shirt like this one and he 
or she is not running, I think we can safely say you're allowed to stop us and 
start a conversation :)

See you all in FOSDEM!

you're around.
