Welcome to Taiga release 3.4.0, Pinus Contorta, named after this popular tree also known as the lodgepole, shore or twisted pine. The name was suggested by one of our team members, Alex, who pointed that this release is chock-full of the most highly desired enhancements. We hope it proves as popular with our community as the Pinus Contorta is beloved in the Western United States.

Pinus Contorta is a stalwart species, well-suited to survive forest fires, and so we look to it as symbol of hope for the recovery of the people and the vast areas affected by this year’s fires in California.

We are proud of the work that's gone into this release 3.4, which puts us at about 75% done with the enhancements planned for 2018.
We hope you enjoy it!

###ATTACH ISSUES TO SPRINT
First off, the highly requested: “[I want to add Issues to a sprint](http://6i66.mjt.lu/lnk/AGMAAAk4jMkAAAAAAAAAAGoSbRYAARpdxKUAAAAAAAey7gBbdnWwVxqwetQHTXCVqSzHc9xfMQAHVPk/2/T_Y2LTgh3EBkhPHJ4izQxA/aHR0cHM6Ly90cmVlLnRhaWdhLmlvL3Byb2plY3QvdGFpZ2EvaXNzdWUvMTE4MQ)” functionality. We held back on this one for quite some time. Until now, when using sprints on the SCRUM module, we only allowed management of users stories. We debated hotly that issues do not belong in
sprints, some believe that fixing errors (tracked by issues) is not really part of the “value” created in a sprint. But others made a compelling case to the contrary, and after a couple years of back and forth, we now bring you Issue-tracking in sprints. Do it from the sprint taskboard, or create an issue and link it to sprint. Enjoy, and weigh in. Tell us what you think!

###LINK USER STORIES TO EPICS
Prior to this you would have to go to an Epic to link a user story to it, now
you can create the link right from the User Story. A real nice time saver!

###REDESIGNED LIGHTBOX
Speaking of time savers, a new, redesigned lightbox that pops open for users stories, tasks and Issues allows the assignment of a team member to that user story, task or issue. We think you’re really going to like the new lightbox look. Less crowded and allowing for more data input.

###DUE DATE WARNINGS

New configurable “warnings” tied to “Due Dates”. Now rather than leaving it to us to alarm your team when due dates were coming up, you can configure the warnings to yourself, creating much
greater flexibility.

###NEW LANGUAGE: PERSIAN/FARSI (INTRODUCING RTL SUPPORT!)

Kudos to Vahid Dayyani for the work on the translation and for the
feedback on our new “right-to-left” support. We know it’s not perfect, but we hope to keep improving with our community’s help. We’re proud to introduce this and other languages in support of our mission to constantly re-enforce our culture of openness through multilingual and multicultural support.
