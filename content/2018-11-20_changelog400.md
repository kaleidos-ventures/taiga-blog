Summary: ![Larix Cajanderi]({filename}/images/2018-11-30_changelog400/Larix_gmelinii.jpg) 2018 has been a great year already for the Taiga family. We continued to grow (even with no marketing expenditure!), we continued building a solid tech support team, and we enjoyed receiving amazing feedback to every single one of our three releases.

Looking back, with the exception of the first couple of years when we were first building Taiga, 2018 has been the most active year with respect to product development.

If you prefer to read the rest of this preface afterwards, simply scroll down to the "So now on to Taiga 4.0!" section.

Internally we very much like (and use) some of our new features including the new item creation dialog, the multiple drag and drop for KANBAN, and the issues section in the sprint taskboard.

Given our strict adherence to traditional Agile methodology, we also like (but use cautiously) other great features such as the Due Date field or the ability to assign a task to multiple users.

We are proudest of how we approached these feature requests, the vast majority of which come from you! We find ourselves listening ever more closely to what you tell us you need, in the process subordinating our own biases while at the same time ensuring we protect the Taiga ethos.

Looking back to our "Taiga plans for 2018" post, we feel we nailed our objectives from a product development standpoint. A couple of minor things are still pending but we have achieved almost double the work we initially intended, and that's great news for everyone!

## SO NOW ON TO TAIGA 4.0!
We're sure you'll agree, it's more than just another great release. For us it's like a new beginning. We worked hard these past months to make sure we are ready for 2019 and all the great challenges that lie ahead.

We started with a massive usability review, did a big cleanup around our whole technology stack, and laid plans for our virtual appliance as well as our partnership with Taiga App creators and our little secret project, Taiga Seedtime. And of course, we have quite a few new features to share with you.

We'd like you to think of Taiga 4.0 as the foundation for great new things to come in the near future! And we've done all this with a highly dedicated small team happy to serve an ever-growing community. We are proud to say that the vast majority of the revenues we earn are plowed right back into product development. We are grateful to you, the members of our community and users of our product. We owe Taiga and to you and remain as committed as ever to delighting you building upon your needs and suggestions.

###MOVE UNFINISHED US FROM ONE OPEN SPRINT TO ANOTHER OPEN SPRINT
**Yep, that's right, one of the top 10 Taiga feature requests of ALL TIME is here!**

It's not unusual in a SCRUM project to close off a sprint despite having unfinished user stories and tasks. You can now carry over over those pesky unfinished pieces to other open sprints.

SCRUM BEST PRACTICES HINT: If you find yourself using this feature often you may want to revisit your sprint planning.

### NOTIFICATIONS AREA
And better still when it comes to notifications: Taiga now has a notifications area that lists all the recent activity on all your projects, and which you can keep and clean up as you see fit. You can decide which projects you want to get notified about.

### SHOWING TIPS UPON LONG LOADING TIMES

Sometimes there's so much info to load that Taiga and your browser will struggle a bit to be fast. Fear not! as we will entertain you with useful tips about Taiga features.

### DROP DOWN CUSTOM FIELD

This is a backlog oldie but goodie. You can now limit (via drop down menu) the possible choices pertinent to a particular custom field.

### BOOLEAN CUSTOM FIELD

This was a no-brainer to offer up. If custom fields can have custom drop-down, why not also offer a yes/no option. Yes? No?

### DEAL WITH TECHFUNDER ON TAIGA APP

As some of you know, Taiga has an iOS and Android app developed independently by TechFunder in Germany. Following multiple requests pushing us to work together on a joint pricing plan, we are thrilled to inform you that soon, paying Taiga customers will receive a 100% discount on the price for using the mobile app. It doesn't get better than that. Please stay tuned for more details.

### PROJECT CODENAME: SEEDTIME

Glad you've read through to the end; as we've held the best for last!

Are you up to join us as we do the final beta testing for a game-changing Taiga module?

We looked at the problem faced by Agile teams estimating time and difficulty for user stories or tasks. What if we provided you with a game-like tool that makes it easy for teams to quickly and effectively estimate? In our own testing, we find it - dare we say, REALLY fun! It's powerful and in our view game-changing. To join in on the beta testing fun please contact **support@taiga.io**, mention the word "seedtime" and tell us more about your team size, and the reason you use Taiga.

### ALSO, PLEASE CHECK THESE OTHER GREAT ADDITIONS!

- **A new project should be in the top of the projects list**  the newest projects you create now appear at the top of the lists of projects. you can always reorder them later, but newest at the top is now the default.
- **The active section icon needed more contrast and character**  a small but useful change, on the left-hand icon screen, the design now makes it more obvious which section on a project you are viewing.
- **Infinite scroll on activity log** on wiki, pages tasks, user stories or issues, you can now enjoy endless scrolling in order to view the older items. (really) faster and better!
- **Improvements for self-installed taiga instance administrators** we worked hard to improve the ease of deployment of self-hosted taiga instances and we improved documentation as well. we did this in part by overhauling some of our aging technology stack. administrators deserve love too!
- **Miscelaneous bug squashing** continued unabated in taiga 4.0
