This release is chock full of bug fixes, minor navigation enhancements and lots of under-the-hood fixes that may not be apparent to everyone.

**New features**

- Real time synchronization. You and your colleagues, working on the same project will instantaneously see any change anyone makes. Yes!
- Issues can become User Stories: With one click, you can promote a pesky issue or bug that will take lots of work to fix and make it its own User Story.
- Made it easier to attach files to issues.
- Our Blog is live at http://blog.taiga.io. Welcome, come right in.

**Bug Fixes and Enhancements (worth mentioning)**

- We improved the metrics reported in the taskboard and backlog headers so they are more meaningful to you. Are they? Let us know.
- We squashed  a bug that was causing strange behavior of browser autofill and angularjs on the login page.
- We slapped down a bug preventing User Stories from being properly ordered on sprints.
- We hunted and mortally wounded a bug that was messing up the project navigation on first page loading.
- We shot dead an issue with searches not coming up correctly
- We did serious damage to a bug that was altering the order of User Stories on the Backlog
- We massacred a poltergeist causing strange behavior on create/destroy/create sprint process

**Documentation**
