###Better onboarding
We know that using a new tool requires some effort. To help you and your team members we created a better onboarding experience so you don't miss any of the basic features in Taiga. Follow (or skip) our joyride and reference our new placeholders to better understand how Taiga works.

###Taiga Themes
With our new themes you can skin Taiga any which way you like. We created some default themes (high contrast, material…) and now you can make your own and share. Here’s a link to the guidelines on how to create Taiga themes. Special Thanks to [@astagi](https://github.com/astagi){target="_blank"}

See [how to create your own themes](http://docs.taiga.io/#themes "Create your own themes"){target="_blank"}.

###Autocomplete
Enjoy a handy dandy autocomplete for usernames, User Stories, Tasks, Issues, and Wiki Pages in the text areas. For example when entering text in the editor, type @+ text and up pops a selector with relevant users. Type # + a number and up pops the list of user stories with that number. Special Thanks to [@brettp](https://github.com/brettp)

##Under the hood improvements

###Things that were nagging us (and you) that needed fixing

- Taiga’s search engine now supports **full text searches** and incomplete words.
- Improved **compatibility with BitBucket’s and GitLab’s API’s.** Now when you create Issues and comments in Bitbucket or GitLab, they are automatically created in Taiga.
- Now when you comment on a User Story, Task or Issue you are **automatically added as a watcher** in order to follow its progress.
- We improved the project export system, which **no longer crashes** when exporting big projects.
- The **timeline is now more useful and relevant**, and shows only the content of the User Stories, Tasks, Issues and Wiki pages in which you are involved and not the content generated by all your contacts. Information overload be gone!
- Don’t want to see the **burndown chart** on the backlog panel? Now you can collapse it.
- We included a **Caps lock warning** in login and register form to reduce login errors. Remember, your username and email are case sensitive!
- Now notification emails which you open in outlook will appear threaded

##Work done by members of our awesome Taiga community
And for which we don’t deserve much credit - if any

###Image preview
If you add an image as an attachment, you can now see a preview of it in a lightbox. No more opening the image in order to see what it is. Thanks to [@brettp](https://github.com/brettp){target="_blank"}.

##The techier improvements

- **Support for authentication via application tokens.** We built a new system to authenticate third party apps, similar to the systems used by Google, Facebook and Twitter. You can now access Taiga data from 3rd party apps using your Taiga login credentials.
- You can now **change the state of multiple elements** with one single commit message For example by typing ```tg-2 #closed tg-23 #in-progress``` element reference number 2 would move to “closed” and number 23 to “in progress.”
- We added **sha1 hash to the API** in order to verify the integrity of attached files and ensure that the files you downloaded are exactly the ones you intended. If you synchronize Taiga with other tools, this allows verification that the file is the same on both platforms. (thanks to [@astagi](https://github.com/astagi)).
- We are now compatible with the new stable version of **Python 3.5**.
- We migrated to the latest stable version on **django 1.8**.
- The **webhooks also got some love**. We added deleted datetime to webhooks responses when User Stories, Tasks or issues are deleted.

Many other small and not so small bugfixes.
