Summary: ![Photo by Martin Sanchez on Unsplash]({filename}/images/2018-02-05_taiga_plans_2018/martin-sanchez-396165.jpg "Photo by Martin Sanchez on Unsplash") **For us at Taiga, 2018 looks like a very promising year**. Last year was a year for us to consolidate and make sure our system works and scales even as more and more members join. And we're proud to say it was smooth sailing. No network glitches or performance problems. Robustness, security and reliability of the platform was our top priority and we think we worked diligently in the background to strengthen and improve everything "backstage".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

**One quick note on security.** At some point later this year we would like to share the results of a third-party OWASP-based pentesting work we contracted. The results were great. For both taiga.io [http://taiga.io/]  and the thousands of private Taiga instances around the world, that is certainly reassuring good news. Were proud of the quality of our open source code, and now it's not just us saying it!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

**BACK TO 2018!**

We're itching to go back to developing new features, lot's of them. But first, we're coming out with a minor release and  some nice quick wins. We decided to temporary halt the very time-consuming Angular2 porting of our code and instead add more stuff that users enjoy.

Here are some of the things you'll find in the upcoming 3.2 release due in just a few weeks:

 * Emojis support on subjects and tags
 * A nice "confirm dialog" before closing edit lightboxes
 * Wiki activity  hidden by default (to speed up wiki page rendering for those activity heavy nodes!)
 * Allow ascending votes ordering  in issues list
 * Multiple selection of Kanban cards to move  them between columns in just one drag&drop.
 * Many bugfixes as usual (but really not that many - and that's something!)

While this is great (we particularly like the Kanban one), what is really exciting is our choice of new features for the next major release. This is when things start to feel sort of, well, major.

As for the functionality improvements now in development... Below are some of the most highly desired features which we are planning to roll out. Some of this might still change.

We're also working on a super-secret project for Taiga that is taking much more time than anticipated but we prefer to be cautious and not say anything more for now! :)

### GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS

**ADD ISSUES TO A SPRINT TASKBOARD**

We already had parent-less tasks but a lot of people asked for a way to link issues to a particular Sprint. While this is not particularly SCRUM-compliant, we believe it could be useful to be watchful of concurrent issues for a sprint. [Issue #1181](https://tree.taiga.io/project/taiga/issue/1181){:target="_blank"}.

**IMPROVE NOTIFICATION SYSTEM**

Merging changes notification over the course of minutes. Instead of receiving 4-5 emails after someone edited a US, you will just receive one with the final changes. [Issue #2165](https://tree.taiga.io/project/taiga/issue/2165){:target="_blank"} and [Issue #5322](https://tree.taiga.io/project/taiga/issue/5322){:target="_blank"}.

**DUE DATES**

A simple way to assign due dates to issues or US and see them change colour depending on their proximity to their due date. [Issue #3069](https://tree.taiga.io/project/taiga/issue/3069){:target="_blank"}.

**NEW CUSTOM FIELD: DROP-DOWN WITH OPTIONS**

We would be adding a new type of custom field that shows a limited set of options to choose from.
[Issue #3725](https://tree.taiga.io/project/taiga/issue/3725){:target="_blank"}

**NOTIFICATIONS AREA**

A new subsection under your profile page where you can see every new citation (people @-ing you) or assignment (somebody assigned you to a US, issue, task or added you as a watcher). [Issue #3752](https://tree.taiga.io/project/taiga/issue/3752){:target="_blank"}.

**TREE-LIKE WIKI PAGES**

Allow nested wiki pages! [Issue #4004](https://tree.taiga.io/project/taiga/issue/4004){:target="_blank"}.

**ASSIGN MULTIPLE USERS TO A USER STORY**

This also looked weird to us because our experience tells us that multiple-assignement comes with the risk of responsibility dilution but let's try and see how people use this. We will then decide whether to apply this change to tasks and issues as well. [Issue #1961](https://tree.taiga.io/project/taiga/issue/1961){:target="_blank"}.

**COPY & PASTE IMAGES DIRECTLY**

Copy & Paste images directly. Some browsers support clipboard image pasting, we plan to allow that for attachments.
[Issue #2004](https://tree.taiga.io/project/taiga/issue/2004){:target="_blank"}.

**ADD FILTER BY ROLE**

For user stories.[Issue #4754](https://tree.taiga.io/project/taiga/issue/4754){:target="_blank"}.

### USABILITY IMPROVEMENTS

**DELETE TASK FROM SPRINT TASKBOARD**

Without having to go into detail view. [Issue #2683](https://tree.taiga.io/project/taiga/issue/2683){:target="_blank"}.

**ADD "ASSIGNED TO" OPTION IN CREATE US/ISSUE/ETC LIGHTBOX**

We really wanted to avoid this one, it felt too much "quick dispatching of tasks" but it had a lot of votes from the community and if we rework the Create lightbox it could fit OK. [Issue #3167](https://tree.taiga.io/project/taiga/issue/3167){:target="_blank"}.

**ADD US TO AN EPIC US**

Improve the way you can bulk add US to an Epic US. [Issue #4604](https://tree.taiga.io/project/taiga/issue/4604){:target="_blank"}.

**ADD US INFORMATION TO EMAIL**

Add US information (link ref) to email task notifications. [Issue #4212](https://tree.taiga.io/project/taiga/issue/4212){:target="_blank"}.

**CHANGE DEFAULT PROJECT VALUES FOR US POINTS AND PROJECT ROLES**

Change default project values for US points and Project roles. Instead of pseudo-Fibonnacci scale and web development roles, we would pick t-shirt sizes and non-standard project roles. This way we hope to encourage agile values and project tweaking from users. [Issue #5320](https://tree.taiga.io/project/taiga/issue/5320){:target="_blank"}.

**NEW EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS**

Send an email notification when a user accepts an invitation to a project. [Issue #2847](https://tree.taiga.io/project/taiga/issue/2847){:target="_blank"}.

**DISPLAY KANBAN CARDS NUMBER AND WIP LIMIT**

Adding number of Kanban cards for column plus WIP limit for that column. [Issue #4311](https://tree.taiga.io/project/taiga/issue/4311){:target="_blank"}.

<br />
2018 will bring major changes to Taiga, changes that we hope will make you happy. We expect to continue growing, this year at an even faster pace. And we will be ready. If you still have friends who haven't used Taiga, this is a great time to turn them on to our tool!

So, yeah, Happy new Year!
