**TL;DR**

Taiga is joining [Digital Ocean’s Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/), an initiative of Digital Ocean to promote participation in open source projects. It is open to everyone and all backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to complete the challenge.

We have chosen some small features we’d like to add to our project management system so you can help us. You can look for them at our [github repository](https://github.com/taigaio/taiga-front/labels/Hacktoberfest) looking for the “hacktoberfest” tag. Before you make your first contribution, you should familiarize yourself with [How To Create a Pull Request](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github).

Among the issues you can help with are making wiki page titles editable, reordering attachments or paste images direct into description fields. Taiga’s programming language is Python. You can check our [documentation for developers](https://tree.taiga.io/support/frequently-asked-questions/how-can-i-contribute-to-taiga/).

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

You can do it anytime until October 31. The first 50,000 participants who successfully complete the challenge will earn a T-shirt. More importantly, you will have contributed to the open source community. Taiga and its estimated million of users all around the world will thank you ;).
