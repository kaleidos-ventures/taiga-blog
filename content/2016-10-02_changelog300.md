Summary: ![Photo by Bart Busschots]({filename}/images/2016-10-02_changelog300/stellaria.jpg) Named after this amazing stellar plant that hails from the northernmost part of the  Northern Hemisphere. Stellaria takes their name from the stars in the boreal sky that they resemble.  And so it is with this, our newest, **biggest-ever new Epic release**: star-filled with shiny features that will make your mind glow!

Working hard as ever, and now actually earning a fair price for the service we provide (thank you to our steadily-growing paying customers!), we have turned your investment in us into bits and bytes of all sorts in an effort to address the features you most requested, and some which we just needed to get out. So, without further ado, here's what we have for you this time:

###MULTIPROJECT EPICS
Epics on Taiga are, well - Epic! Now you can set up user stories and tasks that and assign them to multiple projects. You'll be able to track hierarchical or related relationships between those user stories on different projects. This is particularly useful if your work requires planning across multiple projects, and you wish to set up user stories and tasks that don't belong to just one project.

###REVAMPED CARDS
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and for some, our kanban cards were - shall we say, just a bit too “blah”. And who, pray tell wants “blah”? So from now on make those kanban cards shine. Dress them up with the information that matters most, images, tasks, watchers, votes...etc. Too much info? Use the slider to reduce/increase the amount of info and the size of the card. Worried all that glorious info will slow performance? Never fear, we got you covered!

###KANBAN AND TASKBOARD FILTERS
Too many cards, too much information, so little time? Help us focus on tasks you asked! We hear you. Go ahead and cut down the overload by filtering cards as you do User Stories or issues in your  backlog.

###TAGS EDITABLE COLORS
Some say God is an artist on account of all those millions of colors he gave us. So, how pathetic was it that we offered our tags in just a handful of shades? Enter - our new color panel editor for tags. Use it to better organize your project information with richer visual cues.  While creating a new tag you are now able to choose a color. If you already have a tag assigned to a color, or would like to edit it, use the new editor to change it.

###WIKI HISTORY AND LINKS INDEX
They say those that don’t remember history are doomed to repeat it. Our new wiki history tab keeps a running narrative of of every change in your documentation, so you can make new mistakes, not repeat old ones!

In the wiki category we also have new wiki links (not leaks). Documentation lovers rejoice! All links in your wiki can be now sorted and reordered to suit your fancy.  There is also a new index to find all the pages in your wiki.

###TAIGA MOBILE APP
This one comes courtesy the folks at [@Taiga_App](https://twitter.com/taiga_app) and is community-built. We’ve been dying to build an official mobile app, but Taiga App is so good that it just pushed our own project a few notches down in the priority list. Never mind! You now have access to a great mobile experience. Free for iOS and Android. Check out more at: [http://www.taigaapp.com/](http://www.taigaapp.com/)
