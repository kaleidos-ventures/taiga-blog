Summary: ![Taiga&Kaleidos Team with superpowers]({filename}/images/2015-11-17_agile_awards/01.jpg) I am writing this post at 39.000 feet on my way back from London to Madrid. Yesterday was a great day for Taiga but most importantly, we had so much fun! So there is this thing called [Agile Awards in the UK](https://www.theagileportal.com/awards/nominations){target="_blank"}. It has been going on for 7-8 years now and the different categories acknowledge various aspects of the Agile movement. Projects, people, initiatives... and for the first time this year, they added the Best Agile Tool award.

Some months ago we were nominated by one of our [Kaleidos clients][1], Andrés Fajardo from Wysh (go check their [wysh.travel](https://wysh.travel/){target="_blank"}). He simply said to us "You deserve it" but, honestly, at that time it looked like a long shot. However, it slowly grew on us this idea that it would be so cool to win such an award specially since it is a public cast vote (only 1 vote per Internet domain, though, quite restrictive) and we would need to ask our user base to help us achieve it. And that is what we did through our Taiga 1.9 newsletter a couple of weeks ago.

**Well, we won! We didn't know until our name was said aloud by Nick Highman (BBC News correspondent) but, just in case, we had dressed up and gone to the venue.**

Juan (Taiga designer), Xavier (Taiga front-end developer), Pablo (Kaleidos CTO) and I were there and also Angela (my geeky wife) representing all of Taiga and Kaleidos but also all of you who use and love Taiga, all of you that enjoy local instances or the cloud version, all of you that continue to give us great feedback and report bugs or contribute with amazing code. You were there with us, supporting a fresh and fun way of doing agile. We were competing against big names, great platforms, wonderful teams, but that only made the award so much more exciting... and when we heard "Taiga!" it was so energizing, it was like 80.000 people shouting "yes!".

Before I leave you with a few pictures and the video of the moment we won the award, on behalf of the entire Taiga team, I'd like to thank you again for your support, whether you were able to cast your vote or not, it makes this journey so much fun and fulfulling! Taiga is only 1 year old so this is just the beginning but you will witness, release after release, how we evolve to be, not necessarily a more feature-complete platform, but a better platform. Ultimately, this is about teams enjoying their projects and we will have this metric as the key one, always, even if we are unable to accommodate everyone and we know that's a fact, but it is also our strength, if you know what I mean.

End result, absolutely gorgeous. It felt solid and it stood out.
