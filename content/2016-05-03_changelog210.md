Summary: ![By Steve Hillebrand, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Public domain)]({filename}/images/2016-05-03_changelog2100/ursus_americanus.jpg) So named after the magnificent king of the Taiga, the Black Bear, which the Native American Indians considered a symbol for the free spirit; surely something we can all aspire to become!

Many important things have taken place on May 3rd's: in 1965 satellite TV was used for the first time, In 1851 much of San Francisco was destroyed by Fire, or more apropos, in 1654 the Bridge at Rowley, Massachusetts began charging a toll for crossing animals.

So May 3rd then is the day we at Taiga begin charging a toll (modest and fair - we hope) for our service. It's our way of building a sustainable business to continue delivering a service that will increasingly delight and support your own work. We look forward to having you as a happy, paying customers. Naturally, our free plans will remain in place.

There are a few goodies in this release:

###Added sprint title on search results for user stories
Projects are becoming more and more complicated to manage, we respond to that with an enhancement that makes it easier to search and filter User Stories. if a User Story is already included in a sprint, it will be visible on the search results. Thanks to [@everblut](https://github.com/everblut){:target="_blank"}

###New support page
We have a new fresh new look for our [support page](https://tree.taiga.io/support/){:target="_blank"}. It's better organized and seeks to provide answers quicker.

###Taiga Tutorials at Taiga.pm

###Improved our webhooks
We've received many an email with suggested improvements for our [webhooks](https://docs.taiga.io/#webhooks){:target="_blank"}. We hear you, and here are the first batch of improvements. Developers rejoice:

 - We added permalinks to keep the reference of the update.
 - Seriously improved our webhooks data.
 - Improved webhook legibility on changes.

###CSV reports
To enhance your reports we added two long awaited fields. The estimated sprint start and end fields.

Is that all? Of course not! We nailed many small and not so small bugs and made a good number of small fixes.

Happy Spring!
